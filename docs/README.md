# AI-Powered Cloud Data Pipeline

This project demonstrates a cloud-integrated, AI-enhanced data pipeline using SQL and Python. It simulates real-time ingestion of marketplace sales data (e.g., Mercado Livre, Shopee), processing it via BigQuery and a Python ML model for sales forecasting.

## Features

- Cloud-based ingestion and storage (GCP BigQuery)
- Python-based transformation and forecasting
- Integration-ready structure with scalable design

## Technologies

- SQL
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Google Cloud BigQuery
- JSON (for NoSQL simulations)

## Project Structure

- `pipeline.sql`: Table creation and query processing for BigQuery
- `forecast.py`: Python script for ML forecasting
- `data/`: Sample raw data (JSON format)
- `README.md`, `Readme_PT-BR.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
